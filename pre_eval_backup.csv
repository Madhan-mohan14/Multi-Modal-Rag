What is the projected Real GDP growth for 2025?,The projected Real GDP growth for 2025 is 2.4 percent [Page 61].,"['PR25/034  \n**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  \nWashington, DC – February 11, 2025: On January 27, 2025, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Qatar.  \nGrowth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued, with signs of strengthening activities more recently. Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in 2024–25 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project, and strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4½ percent on average, boosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing reforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will likely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term.', '| Projections                      | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  | 2024  | 2025  | 2026  | 2027  | 2028  | 2029  |\n|----------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| **National Account**             |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |\n| Nominal GDP (billions of Qatari Riyals) | 525.7 | 654.2 | 680.5 | 775.3 | 813.6 | 882.7 | 955.7 | 999.0 | 1027.4 |       |\n| Nominal hydrocarbon GDP (billions of Qatari Riyals) | 152.3 | 240.8 | 380.3 | 345.4 | 317.0 | 267.6 | 315.0 | 359.5 | 367.5 | 364.5 |\n| Nominal nonhydrocarbon GDP (billions of Qatari Riyals) | 373.3 | 413.5 | 477.7 | 470.8 | 496.6 | 532.6 | 637.7 | 599.3 | 660.3 | 663.0 |\n| Real GDP (2018 prices)          | -3.6  | 1.6   | 4.2   | 12.1  | 4.2   | 5.2   | 7.9   | 3.5   | 1.6   |       |\n| Deflator                         | -2.0  | 0.3   | 1.7   | 1.4   | 3.0   | 10.4  | 16.1  | 4.8   | 0.2   |       |', '8. Growth is expected to strengthen gradually in the near term and pick up more forcefully over the medium term. Real GDP growth is projected to improve to 2 percent in 2024, in line with staff’s nowcasting estimates (Text Figure 7 and Annex III), as non-hydrocarbon growth gradually increases, supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project, and strong tourism. Monetary policy easing will likely accelerate domestic credit growth and bolster broader economic activities. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate (to an average of around 4¾ percent) on the back of massive North Field LNG production expansion (a cumulative increase of around 85 percent by 2030), and initial NDS3 reform gains.

What measures did QCB introduce regarding foreign liabilities?,"The context does not mention specific measures introduced by QCB regarding foreign liabilities [Page 52]. However, it is mentioned that declines in commercial banks' foreign liabilities have reduced financial stability risks [Page 52]. Additionally, it is stated that commercial banks' external liability remained broadly unchanged [Page 50].","[""- **Strengthen liquidity forecasting and management.**\n- The QCB has continued to improve liquidity management through T-bill issuance. A recent IMF technical assistance provided a series of recommendations which the QCB is considering.  \n- **Contain banks' exposure to foreign liabilities.**\n- A series of QCB measures have helped reduce banks’ short-term foreign asset-liability mismatches. A comprehensive Third Financial Sector Strategy was published, with plans to deepen domestic financial market which would help boost banks’ domestic funding.  \n- **Continue strengthening efforts to enhance banking sector resilience.**\n- Financial safety net (deposit insurance, recovery/resolution framework) is being enhanced with IMF technical assistance. Measures to limit risks from the real estate sector have been introduced.  \n- **Carefully balance opportunities and risks around fintech and green financing initiatives with adequate regulations.**"", 'On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are estimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023—they will continue to be supported by the projected current account surpluses over the medium term. On the liabilities side, a moderate level of external public debt contributes to strong overall fiscal debt sustainability (Annex IV. Fiscal and Debt Sustainability Assessment). Commercial banks’ external liability remained broadly unchanged, leaving the net foreign liability relatively large.  \n| 2023 (% GDP) | NIIP: NA | Gross Assets: NA | QCB Res.

The authorities concurred with staff’s recommendation to continue exercising vigilance. The QCB highlighted that the newly introduced risk-based supervision strengthened assessment of emerging risks and early action. They believed that banks were well prepared to manage legacy real estate sector weaknesses and the recent macroprudential measures were effectively implemented to address potential risks. The QCB also highlighted banks’ progress in lengthening the average maturity of foreign liabilities including via issuance of medium-term notes, and its commitment to regular risk reassessment. More broadly, the QCB stressed that both the micro and macroprudential measures, including the counter-cyclical capital buffer, were periodically reviewed and would be dynamically adjusted to manage emerging risks. The authorities supported staff’s call for deepening domestic capital markets, highlighting ongoing efforts in this area as part of the FS3 implementation, including an initiative', '20. Vigilant QCB policies have helped secure financial stability, while pockets of vulnerabilities warrant continued diligence. The banking sector remains healthy despite the growth normalization and tighter financial conditions, thanks to robust buffers, diligent QCB policies and ample hydrocarbon liquidity. Recent QCB measures to reduce banks’ short-term foreign asset-liability mismatches and risks in their exposure to a weaker real estate market are welcome, especially as easing global financial conditions could stimulate foreign funding by banks and real estate companies. The QCB should make more granular data (e.g., the average maturity structure of banking sector foreign assets and liabilities, NPLs by sector) available to enhance monitoring and facilitate risk assessment. The NPL ratio will likely remain contained as economic activity picks up and credit demand strengthens. In this context, continued diligence in supervision is important especially for banks with weaker asset', '(Percent of GDP)  \n| Component          | 16 | 18 | 20 | 22 |\n|--------------------|----|----|----|----|\n| Trade Balance       | 20 | 25 | 30 | 28 |\n| Services            | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |\n| Income              | 10 | 12 | 15 | 14 |\n| Current Transfers    | -5 | -6 | -7 | -6 |\n| Current account      | 30 | 37 | 45 | 44 |  \nQCB reserves thus increased only moderately.']",['What was the objective of the recent QCB measures regarding foreign liabilities?']
